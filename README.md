## Problem Statement
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing covid lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.

Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
* How well those variables describe the bike demand

**Input Data** - Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, we are proided a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.
